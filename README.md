# Info

This is an open-source JavaScript (CoffeeScript) widget for editing JSON data structures.
Features include a JSON structural view with buttons for adding and removing objects and arrays, and a text view,
with easy toggling between them, plus undo and redo.

To develop with automatic SCSS and CoffeeScript compilation, run `bundle` and then `bundle exec guard`
