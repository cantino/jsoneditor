This is an open-source JavaScript widget for editing JSON data structures.  Features include a JSON structural view with buttons for adding and removing objects and arrays, and a text view, with easy toggling between them, plus undo and redo.

To develop with automatic scss and coffeescript compilation, do `bundle` and then `bundle exec guard`

The new CoffeeScript version is coming soon.

Feel free to send patches!
